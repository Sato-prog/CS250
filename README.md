SNHU CS250 course submission - Zoltan Cunningham

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

user needs can be interpreted through the user stories, this gives you a guideline on what you need to deliver specifically and the funtionality the program should have in its deliverable state

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Throughout the course I really enjoyed learning about Scrum and hope to use it in the future, It gave clear, defined tasks for each role and everyon not only had a job to do but also hand picked when designing the scrum tean for that job- so it matches their skillset.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member in software development to be hinges on two things- One, your ability to communicate, this includes communicatiing progress AND concerns including things that may hold you back due to personal ability or knowledge. The second most important thing is a commitment to quality work.  This includes things like overall code readilibilty and good code writing- such that it is easy to follow and edit. As well as a quality job that can be said for the product in it's finished state.
